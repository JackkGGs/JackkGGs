# Hello.

### This is just an introduction to everything I've to offer.
I'm a student, Partly a ROBLOX Scripter who has been working on a game for quite a year. It's been fun for me in the programming community as a whole.
I have 6 years worth of Lua Knowledge and 2 years worth of Python Knowledge.

### Several of My Creations:
  - Google Camera Configurations
  - Chatbot based on Llama Vision 3 (Via Together.AI) with Image Recognition System based on OpenCV (YOLOv3-Pt)
  - Translation System (within Command Line input)
  - Fun little Discord Bot (Based on Python)
  - [EfJobR](https://github.com/JackkGGs/EfJobR): a simple job recruiter established on Discord and is based on Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite model. It has randomised parameters, resulting in a not-so-robotic experience.


### Work in Progress
